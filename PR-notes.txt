These are notes on creating a pull request for eeue56/elm-xml.

I have since renamed the package to billstclair/elm-xml-eeu56.

I moved my pull request from a pass-through on myrho's fork to my own direct fork. This fixes four things:

<foo/> now parses correctly. Before it needed attributes or some space before the closing />.

Updated to the latest elm-test, which no longer requires Main.elm or the rtfeldman/node-test-runner package.

Updated to elm-verify-examples and its new doc test syntax.

Added sysconfcpus to .travis.xml for epic Elm compile time improvement, minutes become seconds.

Trimmed the giant 1000-element S3 directory string to 100 elements, to prevent timeouts on Travis.
